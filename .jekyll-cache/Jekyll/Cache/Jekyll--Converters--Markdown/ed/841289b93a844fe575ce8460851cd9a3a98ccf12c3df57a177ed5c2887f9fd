Ksenia Petrichenkoâ€™s artwork investigates the human experience and reflects parallel explorations in life. She is fascinated by the entire spectrum of human emotions, drawing from a wide range of her own lived experiencesâ€”physically, cognitively, and emotionally. A drive to understand the deeper intricacies of life and her own mind led her to the pursuit of knowledge beyond her immediate surroundings, moving far away from her hometown at a young age to seek new experiences and expertise in international environmental issues. Her artistic practice is her primary vehicle into an otherwise turbulent inner world of perplexing feelings and emotionsâ€”to make sense of that which so often goes unexpressed externally. Intuitive and intimate, Kseniaâ€™s art is a pathway for her to pause, reflect, and process, expressing her most labyrinthine thoughts and feelings through shapes, colors, textures, and lines on canvas and paper.</p>

<p>Born and raised in Russia, after spending 10 years in Europe (Budapest and later Copenhagen), Ksenia now resides in Bangkok, Thailand, working full-time as an international expert in the field of sustainable energy by day and as a painter by night.</p>
